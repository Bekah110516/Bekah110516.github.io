  <p> I was born and raised in Suffolk, Virginia (fun fact: once known as the peanut capital of the world). I have now
    lived in Richmond for 3.5 years with my husband, James, and our cat, Matisse. I have many hobbies which primarily
    revolve around being active outdoors which include horsback riding, hiking, gardening, longboarding, and mountain
    biking. I also love music and supporting the local music scene here in Richmond. I currently work as a Licensed
    Veterinary Techninician in a surgical specialty practice. Professionally my dream goal would be to start a
    brand/company with my husband who is also studying tech combining our interests in quality fashion, design, and
    music. </p>
